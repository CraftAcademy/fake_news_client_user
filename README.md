# Fake ? News
Welcome to the main repo of March 2021 cohort's newsroom challenge. 

We have built a fullstack platform that spans 4 different applications:
1. An admin interface where, journalists can write new articles and editors can moderate and view statistics.
2. A client for the users that comprises a daily dose of conspiracies, a forum for localized, user-curated content, as well as general newssite functionality.
3. A backend engine that stores all of our data, controls model associations, and serves API functionality at various endpoints.
4. A mobile client to serve truth-seekers who are on the go.
